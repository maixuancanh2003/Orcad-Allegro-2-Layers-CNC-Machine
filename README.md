## Key Components

1. **Microcontroller**: Processes control commands and interacts with other components of the CNC system.
2. **Drivers**: Integrates drivers to control stepper motors with high precision.
3. **Power Supply**: Provides stable power for the entire system.

## Usage Guide

1. Connect the board to CNC machine components.
2. Install CNC control software to interface with the board.
3. Test and operate the board to ensure all functions are stable.

## Software

This project is designed using **OrCAD/Allegro v17.4** for schematic and PCB design. The software enables high-precision design and effective control over the CNC machine's functionalities.
